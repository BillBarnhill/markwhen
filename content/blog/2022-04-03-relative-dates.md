### Relative Dates

You can now create events using relative dates like "3 days" or "6 weeks" or "2 minutes 3 seconds." Refer to previous events or calculate durations without needing to look at a calendar.

### Percents

You can now indicate that an event is some percent complete by adding a percent anywhere in the event description. Cascade will update the event bar to represent what % of the event is complete.
