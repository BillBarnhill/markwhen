### Pages

One timeline not enough? Create pages (like different sheets in google sheets) to separate timelines however you want.

### Drag & Drop

You can now edit event start and end dates from the timeline instead of doing it in text. Changes will be reflected back to the text.

### Weekends

If you zoom in close enough, weekends will be shaded.
