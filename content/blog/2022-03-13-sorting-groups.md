### Sorting

There's now a button to sort whatever timeline you're viewing, regardless of how it was written. Click the sort button to toggle between ascending, descending, and the original order.

### Groups

You can now group events together by adding a line that says 'group' before the set of events you want to group, followed by 'endGroup.' Thanks to brasilikum on github for suggesting this!

European date format
If you'd rather specify dates in DD/MM/YYYY format, as opposed to MM/DD/YYYY, you can add the following line at the beginning of your timeline:
dateFormat: d/M/y
